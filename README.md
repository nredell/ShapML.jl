# ShapML <img src="./tools/ShapML_logo.png" alt="ShapML logo" align="right" height="138.5" style="display: inline-block;">

The purpose of `ShapML` is to compute stochastic feature-level Shapley values which
can be used to (a) interpret and/or (b) assess the fairness of any machine learning model.
**[Shapley values](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/shapley.html)**
are an intuitive and theoretically sound model-agnostic diagnostic tool to understand both **global feature importance** across all instances in a data set and instance/row-level **local feature importance** in black-box machine learning models.

This package implements the algorithm described in
[Å trumbelj and Kononenko's (2014) sampling-based Shapley approximation algorithm](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10115-013-0679-x)
to compute the stochastic Shapley values for a given instance and model feature.

* **Flexibility**:
    + Shapley values can be estimated for any machine learning model using a simple user-defined `predict()` wrapper function.

* **Speed**:
    + The speed advantage of `ShapML` comes in the form of giving the user the ability to select 1 or more target features of interest and avoid having to compute Shapley values for all model features (i.e., a subset of target features from a trained model will return the same feature-level Shapley values as the full model with all features). This is especially useful in high-dimensional models as the computation of a Shapley value is exponential in the number of features.
